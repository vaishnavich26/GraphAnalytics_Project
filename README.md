Abstract
Understanding customer relationships and their dynamics is crucial for businesses to optimize strategies, improve service delivery, and foster market growth. Traditional clustering methods often fail to capture the nuanced connections within customer-business networks, such as shared customer bases or complementary services. In this research, we explore the use of geometric measures, specifically Ricci curvature, to enhance clustering accuracy and reveal hidden patterns in customer relationships. By constructing a graph of businesses based on mutual customers, we leverage Ollivier-Ricci and Forman-Ricci curvature to incorporate local graph structures and assess their impact on clustering performance.
Our findings indicate that incorporating Ricci curvature provides a more granular understanding of business synergies, enabling the identification of significant customer overlaps that traditional techniques often overlook. Geometric clustering demonstrates improved modularity and entropy metrics, highlighting its ability to uncover richer insights. Furthermore, we benchmark curvature-based clustering against traditional approaches, demonstrating its superiority in capturing meaningful relationships and improving clustering outcomes.
This research underscores the potential of geometric methods in enhancing customer relationship analysis and opens avenues for future studies to refine and apply these techniques in broader domains such as recommendation systems, market segmentation, and urban planning. By integrating advanced geometric measures, we provide a novel perspective on how businesses can better understand and leverage their networks to gain a competitive advantage.
Introduction
Customer review platforms like Yelp have revolutionized how businesses interact with their customers, offering a wealth of data to analyze customer behavior, preferences, and satisfaction. The exponential growth of user-generated reviews creates both opportunities and challenges for businesses and researchers alike. Identifying relationships between businesses, such as shared customer bases or thematic similarities, is crucial for informed decision-making in areas like marketing, product placement, and customer engagement strategies. Traditional clustering methods often fail to capture the nuanced relationships within these data, especially in terms of shared customer behaviors or business synergies.
Graph-based analytics offers a powerful framework to model and analyze these complex relationships. By representing businesses as nodes and shared customers as weighted edges, the graph captures the underlying structure of interactions between businesses. However, conventional graph clustering techniques typically rely on metrics such as degree centrality or edge weight and do not fully utilize the geometric properties of the graph. This limitation inspired the integration of Ricci curvature—a concept from differential geometry—into the analysis of customer relationships in this research.
Ricci curvature provides a unique way to quantify the "spread" or "tightness" of connections in a network. In graph theory, Ollivier-Ricci and Forman-Ricci curvature are adapted from their geometric counterparts to evaluate local and global structural properties. Ollivier-Ricci curvature focuses on the movement of probability distributions across nodes, while Forman-Ricci curvature emphasizes edge-level properties, including weights and connectivity. Both measures add depth to the analysis by highlighting the strength and cohesion of relationships within clusters.
The study focuses on businesses in Phoenix, Arizona, using data from the Yelp dataset. The dataset was filtered to retain businesses with significant customer engagement, such as those with a minimum of 100 reviews and an average rating of four stars or higher. Shared customer relationships were used to construct a weighted graph where edges represent normalized shared customer counts between businesses. The goal is to uncover clusters of businesses that share similar customer bases or themes, leveraging Ricci curvature to enhance the clustering process.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses data preprocessing, including the construction of the graph and calculation of edge weights. Section 3 provides an overview of Ricci curvature and its role in clustering. Section 4 details the clustering methodologies applied, followed by an evaluation of results in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes the research and outlines potential future work.
